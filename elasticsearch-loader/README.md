# Elasticsearch Loader

This folder contains the Docker image for [the Snowplow Elasticsearch Loader][es-loader]

## Introduction

This image is based on [the base image][base-image] which leverages
[the Java 8 Alpine image][alpine-image].

The Elasticsearch Loader runs under [dumb-init][dumb-init] which handles reaping zombie processes
and forwards signals on to all processes running in the container. This image also uses
[su-exec][su-exec], as a sudo replacement, to run the Elasticsearch Loader as the non-root
`snowplow` user.

The container exposes the `/snowplow/config` volume to store the loader configuration. If this
folder is bind mounted then ownership will be changed to the `snowplow` user.

The `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions` and `-XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap` JVM options will be
automatically provided when launching the loader in order to make the JVM adhere to the memory
limits imposed by Docker. For more information, see [this article][jvm-docker-article].

Additional JVM options can be set through the `SP_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable.

## Usage

Running the container without arguments will print out its usage:

```bash
$ VERSION=0.10.2
$ docker run snowplow-docker-registry.bintray.io/snowplow/elasticsearch-loader:${VERSION}

snowplow-elasticsearch-loader $VERSION

Usage: snowplow-elasticsearch-loader [options]

  --help
  --version
  --config <filename>
```

Alternatively, we can mount a configuration folder and run the loader:

```bash
$ docker run \
  -d \
  -v ${PWD}/config:/snowplow/config \
  snowplow-docker-registry.bintray.io/snowplow/elasticsearch-loader:${VERSION} \
  --config /snowplow/config/config.hocon
```

If we want to specify additional JVM options, we can add the `SP_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable:

```bash
$ docker run \
  -d \
  -v ${PWD}/config:/snowplow/config \
  -e 'SP_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m' \
  snowplow-docker-registry.bintray.io/snowplow/elasticsearch-loader:${VERSION} \
  --config /snowplow/config/config.hocon
```
