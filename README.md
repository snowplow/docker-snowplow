# Snowplow Docker

[![License][license-image]][license]

## Introduction

This repository contains the Dockerfiles of base images we use at Snowplow:

- [base-alpine][base-alpine]: Base image of Snowplow apps targeting JDK 8. It is based on Alpine Linux which results in much slimmer images compared to `base-debian`.
- [base-debian][base-debian]: Base image of Snowplow apps targeting JDK 11. It is based on Debian Buster variant of `openjdk:11` image.
- [k8s-dataflow][k8s-dataflow]: Base image of GCP Dataflow apps at Snowplow. It is based on `base-debian` and comes with prerequisite checks necessary to run a Dataflow job.

**Note that** we migrated the maintenance of Dockerfiles for pipeline components from this repository to projects' own repositories.

## Pulling

You can pull the images from the registry directly:

```bash
# base-alpine
docker pull snowplow/base-alpine

# base-debian
docker pull snowplow/base-debian

# k8s-dataflow
docker pull snowplow/k8s-dataflow
```

## Building

Alternatively, you can build them yourself:

```bash
# base-alpine
docker build -t snowplow/base-alpine:latest base-alpine

# base-debian
docker build -t snowplow/base-debian:latest base-debian
